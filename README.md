This code first imports the necessary Python libraries: requests, json, time, bs4, azure.identity, and azure.appservice.web. It also imports the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML response from the WhatsApp API.

The get_message() function gets the latest message from the WhatsApp conversation. The send_message() function sends a message to the WhatsApp conversation.

The get_bard_response() function gets the response from Bard. The main() function first gets the WhatsApp Business API URL. Then, it gets the access token. Then, it gets the Azure credential using the DefaultAzureCredential() function. Then, it creates the Azure App Service using the WebApp() function. Then, it runs the app using the start() method. Then, it enters a loop that continuously gets messages from WhatsApp and sends them to Bard. Bard will then respond to the messages and the responses will be sent back to WhatsApp.

To use this code, you will need to replace the following:

The access_token variable with your WhatsApp Business API access token.
The credential variable with your Azure credential.
The my-app-service variable with the name of your Azure App Service.
You will also need to install the following Python libraries:

requests
json
bs4
azure.identity
azure.appservice.web
Once you have installed the necessary libraries, you can run the code by executing the following command:

Python
python whatsapp_bot.py
